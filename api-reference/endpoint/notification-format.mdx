# Notification Format

When a new video is uploaded to a subscribed YouTube channel, the system sends a notification to your webhook URL. This page describes the format of these notifications.

## Standard Notification Format

The notification is sent as a JSON payload in the body of a POST request to your webhook URL. The payload contains information about the new video and the channel that uploaded it.

```json
{
  "event": "youtube.video.published",
  "video": {
    "id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "title": "Video Title",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "published_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "channel": {
    "id": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
    "name": "Channel Name"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-05-05T10:35:00Z"
}
```

## Original YouTube Data

The notification format is a simplified version of the original Atom XML feed data sent by YouTube. The system parses this XML data and converts it to a more user-friendly JSON format.

Here's an example of the original Atom XML feed data from YouTube:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<feed xmlns:yt="http://www.youtube.com/xml/schemas/2015" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <link rel="hub" href="https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com"/>
  <link rel="self" href="https://www.youtube.com/xml/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"/>
  <title>YouTube video feed</title>

## Handling Notifications in N8N

If you're using N8N, you can create a workflow that starts with a Webhook node to receive these notifications. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a new workflow in N8N
2. Add a Webhook node as the trigger
3. Configure the Webhook node to receive POST requests
4. Use the webhook URL provided by N8N when subscribing to YouTube channels
5. Add nodes to process the notification data as needed

For more details, see the [N8N Integration](/n8n-integration/getting-started) section.

## Testing Notifications

To test your webhook endpoint, you can use the following cURL command to simulate a notification:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "event": "youtube.video.published",
    "video": {
      "id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
      "title": "Test Video",
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
      "published_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "channel": {
      "id": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
      "name": "Test Channel"
    },
    "timestamp": "2023-05-05T10:35:00Z"
  }'
```

<Note>
  Your webhook endpoint should respond with a 2xx status code (e.g., 200 OK) to acknowledge receipt of the notification. If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code, the system will log an error but will not retry the notification.
