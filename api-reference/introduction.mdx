# API Reference

The YouTube Notification System provides a RESTful API that allows you to programmatically manage subscriptions to YouTube channels and receive notifications when new videos are uploaded.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api
```

## Authentication

The API currently does not require authentication. All endpoints are publicly accessible.

<Note>
  While authentication is not required, you should keep your `userKey` (returned when subscribing) private as it can be used to manage your subscriptions.
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

The API currently does not implement rate limiting. However, as a best practice, you should limit your requests to avoid potential service disruptions.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Subscribe"
    icon="bell-plus"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/subscribe"
  >
    Subscribe to YouTube channel notifications
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Subscription Status"
    icon="bell"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/subscription-status"
  >
    Check the status of your subscriptions
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Unsubscribe"
    icon="user-minus"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/unsubscribe"
  >
    Unsubscribe from YouTube channels
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Notification Format"
    icon="gear"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/notification-format"
  >
    Learn about the notification format sent to your webhook
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- `2xx` range indicates success
- `4xx` range indicates an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted)
- `5xx` range indicates an error with our servers

All error responses include a JSON object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "A human-readable message providing more details about the error."
}
```

## Webhooks

When a new video is uploaded to a subscribed YouTube channel, the system will send a POST request to your webhook URL with the notification data.

The webhook payload will include the following properties:

```json
{
  "event": "youtube.video.published",
  "video": {
    "id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "title": "Video Title",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "published_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "channel": {
    "id": "UC1234567890",
    "name": "Channel Name"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:05:00Z"
}
```
