# Getting Started with N8N

N8N is a powerful workflow automation tool that allows you to connect various services and automate workflows without coding. The YouTube Notification System has built-in support for N8N, making it easy to receive notifications when new videos are uploaded to your favorite YouTube channels.

## What is N8N?

[N8N](https://n8n.io/) is an open-source workflow automation tool that helps you connect different services and automate tasks. It provides a visual interface for creating workflows, making it accessible to users without programming experience.

## Why Use N8N with YouTube Notification System?

Using N8N with the YouTube Notification System offers several advantages:

1. **Simplified Setup**: Our system automatically handles all the complex parts of YouTube subscriptions.
2. **Workflow Automation**: Process YouTube notifications and trigger actions in other services.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transform notification data into the format required by other services.
4. **Conditional Logic**: Create complex workflows with conditional logic based on video metadata.
5. **Integration with Other Services**: Connect YouTube notifications to hundreds of other services like Slack, Discord, Email, and more.

## Setting Up N8N

### Step 1: Install N8N

You can install N8N in several ways:

- **Cloud**: Sign up for [N8N Cloud](https://www.n8n.cloud/)
- **Desktop App**: Download the [N8N Desktop App](https://n8n.io/download/)
- **Self-hosted**: Follow the [self-hosting instructions](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/)

### Step 2: Create a New Workflow

1. Open N8N and click on "Workflows" in the sidebar
2. Click "Create New Workflow"
3. Give your workflow a name, such as "YouTube Notifications"

### Step 3: Add a Webhook Node

1. Click the "+" button to add a node
2. Search for "Webhook" and select it
3. Configure the Webhook node:
   - Set "Authentication" to "None"
   - Set "HTTP Method" to "POST"
   - Click "Add Option" and select "Response Mode"
   - Set "Response Mode" to "Last Node"
   - Click "Add Option" and select "Response Code"
   - Set "Response Code" to "200"
   - Click "Add Option" and select "Response Data"
   - Set "Response Data" to "success"

4. Click "Execute Node" to activate the webhook
5. Copy the webhook URL (it should look like `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/youtube-notifications`)

### Step 4: Subscribe to YouTube Channels

Use the webhook URL from Step 3 to subscribe to YouTube channels using our API:
    
    ```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api/subscribe' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/youtube-notifications",
    "channelIds": ["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw", "UCsvqVGtbbyHaMoevxPAq9Fg"]
  }'
```

### Step 5: Process Notifications

Now you can add nodes to process the YouTube notifications:

1. Add nodes after the Webhook node to process the data
2. Use the "JSON Parse" node if you need to parse the notification data
3. Add conditional logic using the "IF" node
4. Connect to other services using their respective nodes

## Example Workflow: Send YouTube Notifications to Discord

Here's a simple example of how to send YouTube notifications to a Discord channel:

1. Start with the Webhook node as described above
2. Add a "Discord" node:
   - Set "Resource" to "Message"
   - Set "Operation" to "Send"
   - Configure your Discord credentials
   - Set "Channel" to your Discord channel ID
   - Set "Content" to a message using the data from the webhook, for example:
     ```
     New video from {{$json.channel.name}}: {{$json.video.title}}
     Watch here: {{$json.video.url}}
     ```

3. Save and activate the workflow

Now, whenever a new video is uploaded to one of the subscribed channels, N8N will receive the notification and send a message to your Discord channel.

## N8N Dual Webhook Support

Our system provides special support for N8N webhooks:

1. **Automatic Detection**: We automatically detect N8N webhook URLs (containing "webhook-test")
2. **Dual Webhook Support**: When you subscribe using an N8N test webhook URL, we automatically create a subscription for the corresponding production webhook URL
3. **Bidirectional Forwarding**: Notifications are sent to both test and production webhooks, ensuring you don't miss any during development

This means you can develop and test your workflows in N8N's test environment, and when you're ready to move to production, your subscriptions will already be set up.

## Advanced N8N Features

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can explore more advanced N8N features:

- **Error Handling**: Add error handling nodes to manage failures
- **Scheduled Triggers**: Add scheduled triggers to check subscription status periodically
- **Data Mapping**: Use the "Function" node for complex data transformations
- **Multiple Webhooks**: Create multiple workflows for different YouTube channels
- **Persistent Data**: Use the "Set" node to store data between executions

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with your N8N integration, check these common problems:

1. **Webhook URL Accessibility**: Ensure your N8N instance is publicly accessible
2. **Workflow Activation**: Make sure your workflow is activated
3. **Node Configuration**: Verify that all nodes are configured correctly
4. **Execution Logs**: Check the execution logs in N8N for errors

<Note>
  Remember to keep your N8N instance running to receive notifications. If you're using the desktop app or a self-hosted instance, make sure it stays online.
