# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when using the YouTube Notification System and provides solutions to help you resolve them.

## Subscription Issues

### Subscription Verification Failed

**Symptoms:**
- You receive an error message indicating that subscription verification failed
- The subscription status shows "verification failed"

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Webhook URL is not publicly accessible**
   - Ensure your webhook URL is accessible from the internet
   - If using a local development environment, consider using a service like ngrok to expose your local server

2. **Firewall or security settings**
   - Ensure your server allows incoming POST requests from our notification system
   - Check if there are any firewall rules blocking requests from our servers

3. **Webhook timeout**
   - Your webhook must respond quickly (within a few seconds)
   - Optimize your webhook to respond faster to incoming requests

<Note>
  Remember that our system handles all webhook verification with YouTube automatically. Your webhook only needs to be able to receive POST requests with notification data.
</Note>

### Subscription Expired

**Symptoms:**
- You stop receiving notifications for a channel
- The subscription status shows "expired"

**Solutions:**
- Renew the subscription using the [Subscribe endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/subscribe)
- Set up automatic renewal by periodically calling the Subscribe endpoint with the same parameters

### Invalid Channel ID

**Symptoms:**
- You receive an error when trying to subscribe to a channel
- The error message indicates an invalid channel ID

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're using the correct channel ID format (e.g., `UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw`)
- To find a channel ID:
  1. Go to the YouTube channel page
  2. View the page source (right-click and select "View Page Source")
  3. Search for "channelId"
  4. The channel ID starts with "UC" followed by 22 characters

## Notification Issues

### Not Receiving Notifications

**Symptoms:**
- New videos are uploaded to subscribed channels, but you don't receive notifications

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Subscription expired or not verified**
   - Check the subscription status using the [Subscription Status endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/subscription-status)
   - Renew the subscription if it has expired

2. **Webhook URL changed**
   - If your webhook URL has changed, you need to create a new subscription with the new URL

3. **Webhook server issues**
   - Ensure your webhook server is running and accessible
   - Check server logs for any errors when processing notifications

4. **YouTube API issues**
   - Rarely, YouTube's PubSubHubbub hub may experience issues
   - Check if other subscriptions are working correctly

### Duplicate Notifications

**Symptoms:**
- You receive multiple notifications for the same video

**Solutions:**
- Implement deduplication logic in your webhook handler
- Use the video ID as a unique identifier to detect duplicates
- Store processed video IDs and check against them before processing new notifications

## N8N Integration Issues

### N8N Webhook Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Subscriptions with N8N webhook URLs fail to verify
- You don't receive notifications in your N8N workflow

**Solutions:**
1. **Ensure N8N is running**
   - Make sure your N8N instance is running and accessible
   - If using the desktop app, keep it open

2. **Check webhook configuration**
   - Verify that the webhook node is configured correctly
   - Ensure the webhook is activated (has a green dot)

3. **Check N8N URL format**
   - Make sure you're using the correct webhook URL format from N8N
   - The URL should look like `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/youtube-notifications`

4. **Check execution logs**
   - In N8N, go to "Executions" to see if there are any errors
   - Look for failed executions and check the error messages

### N8N Workflow Not Processing Notifications

**Symptoms:**
- Notifications are being received by N8N, but the workflow isn't processing them correctly

**Solutions:**
1. **Check node configurations**
   - Verify that all nodes in your workflow are configured correctly
   - Test each node individually to identify the issue

2. **Check data mapping**
   - Ensure you're accessing the notification data correctly in your nodes
   - Use the "Debug" node to see the data structure at different points in the workflow

3. **Update N8N**
   - Make sure you're using the latest version of N8N
   - Update any nodes that might be outdated

## API Rate Limits

### Rate Limit Exceeded

**Symptoms:**
- You receive a 429 Too Many Requests error
- The error message indicates that you've exceeded the rate limit

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce API request frequency**
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Cache responses when appropriate

2. **Optimize API usage**
   - Batch operations when possible
   - Only request the data you need
