# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you quickly set up and start using the YouTube Notification System to receive real-time notifications when new videos are uploaded to your favorite YouTube channels.

## Using the API

The YouTube Notification System is a REST API that you can use directly without any installation. You'll interact with the API endpoints using HTTP requests.

### Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api
```

## Step 1: Subscribe to YouTube Channels

To start receiving notifications, you need to subscribe to one or more YouTube channels using the Subscribe endpoint.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api/subscribe' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "channelIds": ["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"],
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint"
  }'
```

Replace `UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw` with the YouTube channel ID you want to subscribe to, and `https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint` with your actual webhook URL that will receive the notifications.

### Finding a YouTube Channel ID

To find a YouTube channel ID:

1. Go to the YouTube channel page
2. View the page source (right-click and select "View Page Source")
3. Search for "channelId"
4. The channel ID starts with "UC" followed by 22 characters


Alternatively, you can use a [web tool](https://commentpicker.com/youtube-channel-id.php) to find the YouTube channel ID.

### Response

If successful, you'll receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "userKey": "abc123def456ghij",
  "message": "Subscribed successfully",
  "newlySubscribedChannels": ["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"],
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint"
}
```

Save the `userKey` as it can be useful for managing your subscription later.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Webhook Endpoint

Your webhook endpoint needs to be able to receive POST requests with JSON data. The YouTube Notification System handles all the verification with YouTube's PubSubHubbub hub automatically, so you don't need to implement any special verification logic on your end.

<Note>
  The system automatically handles all webhook verification with YouTube. You don't need to implement any verification logic yourself.
</Note>

## Step 3: Check Subscription Status

After subscribing, you can check the status of your subscriptions using the Subscription Status endpoint:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api/subscription-status?webhookUrl=https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint'
```

This will return information about your subscriptions, including whether they've been verified by YouTube and when they expire.

## Step 4: Receive Notifications

Once your subscription is verified, you'll start receiving notifications at your webhook URL whenever a new video is uploaded to the subscribed channels.

Notifications are sent as JSON payloads in POST requests:

```json
{
  "event": "youtube.video.published",
  "video": {
    "id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "title": "Video Title",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "published_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "channel": {
    "id": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
    "name": "Channel Name"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-05-05T10:35:00Z"
}
```

## Step 5: Renew Subscriptions

YouTube PubSubHubbub subscriptions expire after approximately 10 days. To ensure you continue receiving notifications, you should renew your subscriptions before they expire.

To renew, simply use the same Subscribe endpoint with the same parameters:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api/subscribe' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "channelIds": ["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"],
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint"
  }'
```

## Using N8N for Automation

If you want to automate your workflows, you can use N8N with the YouTube Notification System.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an N8N Webhook">
    1. In N8N, create a new workflow
    2. Add a Webhook node as the trigger
    3. Configure it to receive POST requests
    4. Copy the webhook URL provided by N8N
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Subscribe using the N8N webhook URL">
    Use the Subscribe endpoint with your N8N webhook URL:
    
    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url 'https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api/subscribe' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "channelIds": ["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw"],
        "webhookUrl": "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/youtube"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build your workflow">
    Add nodes to your N8N workflow to process the notifications and perform actions like:
    - Sending messages to Discord, Slack, or other platforms
    - Saving video information to a database
    - Triggering other workflows or services
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up automatic renewal">
    Create a scheduled trigger in N8N to call the Subscribe endpoint every 9 days to renew your subscriptions before they expire.
  </Step>
</Steps>
