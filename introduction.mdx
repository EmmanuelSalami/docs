# YouTube Notification System

The YouTube Notification System is a powerful API that allows you to receive real-time notifications when new videos are uploaded to your favorite YouTube channels. This documentation will help you get started with the API and show you how to integrate it into your applications.

## How It Works

The YouTube Notification System uses YouTube's PubSubHubbub (WebSub) protocol to subscribe to channel updates. Here's how it works:

1. **Subscribe**: You provide a webhook URL and a list of YouTube channel IDs to our API.
2. **Verification**: Our system registers your subscription with YouTube's PubSubHubbub hub and handles all verification automatically.
3. **Notification**: When a new video is uploaded to one of the subscribed channels, YouTube sends a notification to our system, which we then forward to your webhook URL.
4. **Processing**: Your webhook endpoint receives the notification and can process it according to your needs.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive notifications as soon as new videos are uploaded.
- **Multiple Channels**: Subscribe to multiple YouTube channels with a single webhook URL.
- **Subscription Management**: Add or remove channels from your subscription as needed.
- **Subscription Status**: Check the status of your subscriptions at any time.
- **N8N Integration**: Built-in support for N8N workflows, including automatic dual webhook support.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use REST API with clear documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the YouTube Notification System, follow these steps:

1. **Subscribe to Channels**: Use the [Subscribe endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/subscribe) to subscribe to YouTube channels.
2. **Check Subscription Status**: Use the [Subscription Status endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/subscription-status) to verify that your subscription is active.
3. **Handle Notifications**: Set up your webhook endpoint to receive and process notifications.
4. **Manage Subscriptions**: Add or remove channels as needed using the [Subscribe](/api-reference/endpoint/subscribe) and [Unsubscribe](/api-reference/endpoint/unsubscribe) endpoints.

## Example: Subscribing to Channels

Here's a simple example of how to subscribe to YouTube channels using cURL:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://youtube-notifier.vercel.app/api/subscribe' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint",
    "channelIds": ["UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw", "UCsvqVGtbbyHaMoevxPAq9Fg"]
  }'
```

## Example: Receiving Notifications

When a new video is uploaded to a subscribed channel, your webhook will receive a notification like this:

```json
{
  "event": "youtube.video.published",
  "video": {
    "id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "title": "Video Title",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "published_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-05-05T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "channel": {
    "id": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
    "name": "Channel Name"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-05-05T10:35:00Z"
}
```

## N8N Integration

The YouTube Notification System has built-in support for N8N, a powerful workflow automation tool. With N8N, you can easily create workflows that process YouTube notifications and trigger actions in other services.

To learn more about using N8N with the YouTube Notification System, see the [N8N Integration](/n8n-integration/getting-started) section.

## API Reference

The YouTube Notification System provides a simple REST API for managing subscriptions and receiving notifications. The API endpoints are documented in the [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/subscribe) section.

<Note>
  Remember to renew your subscriptions regularly, as YouTube's PubSubHubbub hub automatically expires subscriptions after a certain period (typically 10 days).
