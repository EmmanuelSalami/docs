# YouTube Notification System Documentation

## Project Overview

The YouTube Notification System is a serverless API built with Next.js for subscribing to YouTube channel updates and integrating with N8N for automation. It allows you to receive real-time notifications when new videos are published on channels you've subscribed to.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Channel Subscriptions**: Subscribe to multiple YouTube channels with a single API call
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Receive notifications as soon as new videos are published
- **N8N Integration**: Forward notifications to N8N webhooks for automation
- **Subscription Status**: Check the status of your subscriptions at any time
- **Auto-Renewal**: Automatically renew subscriptions before they expire

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Subscribe API**: Registers your webhook URL and the channel IDs you want to subscribe to with YouTube's PubSubHubbub hub
2. **YouTube Notification System**: YouTube sends notifications to our system when new videos are published
3. **Webhook Receiver**: Our system receives the notifications and processes them
4. **Notification Forwarding**: The notifications are forwarded to your webhook URL
5. **N8N Workflows**: Your N8N instance receives the notifications and triggers automation workflows

## Getting Started

To get started with the YouTube Notification System, follow these steps:

1. **Create an N8N Webhook**: Set up a webhook in N8N to receive notifications
2. **Subscribe to Channels**: Use the Subscribe API to register your webhook URL and the channel IDs you want to subscribe to
3. **Build Automation Workflows**: Create workflows in N8N to process the notifications
4. **Set Up Auto-Renewal**: Set up a workflow to automatically renew subscriptions before they expire

## Quick Start

To subscribe to YouTube channels, use the Subscribe API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-url.com/api/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channelIds": ["UCxxx", "UCyyy"],
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-webhook-url.com"
  }'
```
