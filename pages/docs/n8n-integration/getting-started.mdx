# Getting Started with N8N Integration

This guide will help you set up N8N to work with the YouTube Notification System. N8N is a powerful workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different services and automate tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. An N8N instance set up and running
2. Access to the YouTube Notification System
3. YouTube channel IDs you want to subscribe to

## Setting Up the Webhook Node

The first step is to set up a webhook node in N8N to receive notifications from the YouTube Notification System:

1. In your N8N workflow, add a new **Webhook** node
2. Configure it as follows:
   - **Authentication**: None
   - **HTTP Method**: POST
   - **Path**: Choose a unique path (e.g., `/youtube-notifications`)
   - **Response Mode**: Last Node
   - **Response Code**: 200
   - **Response Data**: JSON

3. Save the node and copy the webhook URL (it should look like `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/youtube-notifications`)

## Subscribing to YouTube Channels

Now that you have your webhook URL, you can subscribe to YouTube channels using the YouTube Notification System:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-url.com/api/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channelIds": ["UCxxx", "UCyyy"],
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/youtube-notifications"
  }'
```

Replace `UCxxx` and `UCyyy` with the actual YouTube channel IDs you want to subscribe to.

## Processing Notifications

When a new video is published on one of the subscribed channels, the YouTube Notification System will send a notification to your webhook URL. The notification will contain information about the video, including:

- Video ID
- Title
- Channel ID
- Channel Title
- Publication Date
- Description
- Thumbnail URLs

You can use this information to trigger actions in your N8N workflow, such as:

- Sending a notification to Slack, Discord, or other messaging platforms
- Creating a social media post
- Adding the video to a database
- Triggering other automation workflows

## Setting Up Auto-Renewal

Subscriptions to YouTube channels expire after a certain period (usually 7 days). To ensure you continue receiving notifications, you should set up a workflow to automatically renew your subscriptions before they expire:

1. In N8N, create a new workflow
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** node and configure it to run every 6 days
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node and configure it as follows:
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URL**: `https://your-api-url.com/api/subscribe`
   - **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - **Body**: 
     ```json
     {
       "channelIds": ["UCxxx", "UCyyy"],
       "webhookUrl": "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/youtube-notifications"
     }
     ```
4. Save and activate the workflow

This will ensure that your subscriptions are renewed before they expire, so you continue receiving notifications.

## Next Steps

Now that you have set up the basic integration, you can explore more advanced workflows. Check out the [Workflow Examples](/docs/n8n-integration/workflow-examples) page for ideas on how to use the YouTube Notification System with N8N.
